# Simple Validators module for Meteor Astronomy

This package is an extension of the core validation package [`jagi:astronomy-validators`](https://github.com/jagi/meteor-astronomy). The core package uses functional validators where
writing validation rules requires a little bit more of code to be written. However functional validators are faster and more powerful then simple validators in this package. The simple validators are a lot more concise.

A detailed information about module can be found on [this Wiki page](https://github.com/jagi/meteor-astronomy/wiki/Simple-Validators).
