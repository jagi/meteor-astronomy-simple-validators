# Simple Validators module for Meteor Astronomy

This package is an extension of the core validation package [`jagi:astronomy-validators`](https://atmospherejs.com/jagi/astronomy-validators). The core package uses functional validators where
writing validation rules requires a little bit more of code to be written. Functional validators are faster and more powerful than simple validators. However, simple (string) validators are a lot more concise.

A detailed information about this module can be found [here](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#simple-validators).
